# BiasDF
Official implementation of the paper 'Bias Analysis for Synthetic Face Detection: A Case Study of the Impact of Facial Attributes'
Abstract.

🧠 Facial Attribute Generator + Image Creator
===========================================

This project includes two Python scripts:

1. `generate_input_description.py`  
   ➤ Generates a CSV file containing all combinations of facial attributes, one-hot encoded features, and natural-language descriptions.

2. `generate_images.py`  
   ➤ Uses Stable Diffusion to generate 4 images per description from the CSV file.

-------------------------------------------
📦 Requirements
-------------------------------------------

- Python 3.8 or higher

Install the required packages:

    pip install pandas torch diffusers transformers pillow

-------------------------------------------
📁 File Structure
-------------------------------------------

- generate_input_description.py : Generates data and descriptions  
- generate_images.py            : Generates images using Stable Diffusion  
- df_input_description.csv      : Output CSV file (generated by script 1)  
- images_diff/                  : Folder where images will be saved (by script 2)


📄 Script 1: generate_input_description.py
=================================================

This script creates:

- All possible attribute combinations
- One-hot encoded binary vectors
- A readable natural-language description for each combination

Each row in the output CSV contains a combination like:

    no attractive woman and old and gray hair and wavy hair and white skin and green eyes and Mustach and heavy makeup and pointy nose and square face

----------------------------------
🔧 How to Use Script 1 (Step by Step)
----------------------------------

1️⃣ Open a terminal or command prompt  
2️⃣ Make sure you're in the folder where the script is saved  
3️⃣ Run the script using:

    python generate_input_description.py --output ./df_input_description.csv

✔️ This will generate a file named `df_input_description.csv` in your current directory.

📌 To customize the attributes (e.g., add “emotion”), modify the `attributes` dictionary at the top of the script.

Example:

    "Emotion": ["happy", "sad", "angry"]


🖼️ Script 2: generate_images.py
=================================================

This script reads the `df_input_description.csv` file and generates 4 images per row using the Stable Diffusion model `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`.

Each image is generated from the corresponding `description` column in the CSV.

The generated images are saved in the folder you specify (default: `images_diff`).

----------------------------------
🖥️ How to Use Script 2 (Step by Step)
----------------------------------

1️⃣ Make sure you've already generated `df_input_description.csv` using Script 1  
2️⃣ Open a terminal  
3️⃣ Run the script using:

    python diff_model_img_generation.py --input ./df_input_description.csv --output ./images_diff

✔️ This will read your CSV file and save images like:

    img_diff_0_1.png  
    img_diff_0_2.png  
    img_diff_0_3.png  
    img_diff_0_4.png  
    ...
    img_diff_1_1.png  
    ...

📂 All images will be saved in the folder `images_diff` (or any folder you choose using `--output`).

✅ GPU will be used automatically if available. Otherwise, it runs on CPU (but slower).



🎨 Generate Images Using StyleGAN3
=================================================

To generate high-quality images using **StyleGAN3**, you can use the repository:

🔗 https://github.com/MingtaoGuo/Face-Attribute-Editing-StyleGAN3.git

This repository allows you to generate faces from attribute-based prompts using a modified version of StyleGAN3.  
You can feed the same `description` field generated by `generate_input_description.py` as input prompts (with adjustments to format if needed).

📌 Note: You will need a proper StyleGAN3 model and pre-trained weights to use this tool effectively. Please refer to the repo's instructions.



📊 Add Deepfake Detection Score for Bias Analysis
=================================================

After generating the images, you can evaluate them using your **Deepfake Detection model**.

The model should return a **score** (e.g., prediction probability) for each image, which you can append as a new column `score` in your dataset.

You can then perform **fairness or bias analysis** by comparing score distributions across different groups defined by facial attributes (e.g., gender, age, skin tone).

📌 Example workflow:

1. Load the generated images  
2. Run your deepfake detection model on each image  
3. Save the output score (e.g., confidence of being fake)  
4. Merge the scores back to the corresponding entries in `df_input_description.csv`  
5. Analyze bias using metrics like:
   - Brisk
   - EOD
   - ...

✅ This enables a full pipeline from synthetic data generation to fairness evaluation of AI models.
